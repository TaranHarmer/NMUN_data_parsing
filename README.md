# NMUN_data_parsing
Python script I created in 2022 used to parse the data on the percentage of people living under the poverty line grouped into continents.
This data was taken from the United Nations and was used as part of my participation in the National Model United Nations 2022 in New York as the GA1 delegate representing the Federative Republic of Brazil.
